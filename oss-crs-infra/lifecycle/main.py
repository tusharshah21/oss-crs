"""Lifecycle sidecar: signals when all watched CRS containers have exited.

Monitors Docker container events for a set of Compose services and writes
a ready signal to the exchange directory once every watched service has
stopped.  This lets an ensemble CRS know that no more artifacts will arrive.

NOTE: This implementation relies heavily on the Docker Engine API (container
events via /var/run/docker.sock).  To support other platforms (e.g. Kubernetes),
the monitoring logic can be rewritten against their native APIs (e.g. Pod watch)
and selected at runtime via an environment variable such as LIFECYCLE_BACKEND.
